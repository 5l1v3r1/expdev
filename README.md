This is a list of vulnerable software, which I used to prepare for OSCE course.

The `env` folder contains some software that I used on my Windows XP box. I decided to include it beucause it seems to be hard to find old versions of software (such as windbg).

The `exploitable` folder contains vulnerable software and my exploit. This software has well documented flaws.

Now it has:

* Easy RM to MP3
* Millenium MP3 Studio
* Soritong MP3 Player 1.0
* DVDXPlayer
